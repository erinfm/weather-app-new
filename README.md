# Weather App

**Project in progress**

Fetches and displays current weather data for a user-chosen city. Uses vanilla Javascript, CSS, HTML, OpenWeatherMap API and TimeZoneDB API. User needs to **recreate config.js file** with their own OpenWeatherMap API and TimeZoneDB API keys before use.

### Create config.js

To use, first create config.js file containing the following:

```
const config = {
  OWM_API_KEY: " your OpenWeatherMap API Key ",
  TIMEZONEDB_API_KEY: " your TimeZoneDB API Key",
}
```
